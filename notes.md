# Notes
This file consists of notes that aren't yet in any order.  It's got cribs so we can DRY and links to the most important information on the topic.   

## Sawtooth is a set of systemd services by default:

* Rest API
* Transaction processors
* Validator Registry

## Creating a sawtooth genesis block

To create a sawtooth genesis block you make keys, and then you turn those keys into a genesis block with a set of commands.  Then you're left with a genesis.batch file AND genesis batch is printed to /var/lib/sawtooth/genesis.batch after it is generated. 

## How to actually deploy the generated batch file as described here: 

https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sysadmin_guide/setting_up_sawtooth_poet-sim.html
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/architecture/journal.html

## Where Sawtooth should meet tendermint and vice versa

So the idea here is to take Sawtooth's notion of an "app" and Pair it with tendermint as the consensus engine.  

**Sawtooth's composition: 40% rust and 60% Python -@danintel from sawtooth chat**

[sawtooth consensus faq](https://github.com/danintel/sawtooth-faq/blob/master/consensus.rst#id21)

Following this guide "how do I change sawtooth consensus" it would seem that we need to prepare a drop-in module that has all of the same interfaces that the current consensus bits have.  

## Batches

"Batches are the atomic unit of state change"

[transaction batching guide](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html)

Here, it would seem to be necessary to modify Tendermint to support such batches.  

## Sawtooth-pbft

Sawtooth-pbft is composed of a set of docker containers that can launch a pbft sawtooth test network.  I'm not sure that anything has been built on it yet, but I'm trying to find out.  It seems like the consensus mechanism for sawtooth-pbft is written in Rust, but I'm just judging by the fact that it uses the cargo compiler.  I still haven't made an exact determination of how sawtooth components written in different languages / run in different containers talk to one another (though clearly they use protocol buffers.)


Sawtooth-pbft does not compile:

```

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0053`.
error: Could not compile `sawtooth-pbft`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```

Maybe sawtooth-pbft requires a higher version of Ubuntu like 18.04 despite all sawtooth reqs stating 16.04?  (Guessing this from the version mismatch in sawtooth-pbft's docker compose file)

## sawtooth-raft
```
Sawtooth Raft is a consensus engine for Hyperledger Sawtooth based on the crash fault tolerant consensus algorithm Raft. Specifically, it is built on top of the Rust implementation of Raft used by TiKV, raft-rs.

Currently, Sawtooth Raft is in the prototype phase of development and there is additional work to be done in order to make it production worthy.
```

Sawtooth-raft requires multiple machines to run, there is no containerized single-machine configuration like pbft has.  

**need to re-run these tests with more than a single server**

## applying lessons from sawtooth-raft and sawtooth-pbft


## Tendermint

Here are the big difficulties I see for moving tendermint over to this design pattern:

* TM transactions are not batched and there's no inbuilt processing for batched transactions.  There may not be any support whatsoever for the `sawtooth batch` type commands.  This is of course surmountable but it's significant.  
* The tendermint light client features a native REST API, but it's incomplete and it's not going to be compatible (conceptually) with Sawtooth's native REST API. 
* If 0mq serves anything other than consensus, then we'll need to bring 0mq into the tendermint application architecture.  


## Full container Loadout for sawtooth:
This command starts a validator with the following components attached to it:

REST API (available on host port 8008)
IntKey transaction processor (Python implementation)
Settings transaction processor
XO transaction processor (Python implementation)
Shell (for running Sawtooth commands)
